# Welcome to HR Space

HR Space is an application for the resources department of a company.
The application maintaines a list of current employees, manages requests for
leave and booked leave.

The workplace is a factory, which runs 7 days a week, 12 hour days and no
nights.  The work is continuous, not seasonal and there is now ebb and flow of
work.

## Purpose & Functioning
Other than functioning as a recored of employed staffhere are agreed minimum
staffing levels in the various roles within the factory.
The criteria for leave being granted is that:

*  Minimum staffing levels are always met.
*  The member of staff has leave to use.
*  The leave is reasonably requested 2 weeks in advance.

There is no preferential treatment. Holiday is given on a first come, first served basis, whilst the amount of people allowed off at any one time, is in line with the minimum staffing levels and the person's job role requirements.


The application's default setting for leave requests, is that any
applications made, either too early or made too late will be rejected.

However, this can be overridden for special circumstances if required.
